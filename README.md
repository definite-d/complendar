# üéâ Complendar: Convert Google Sheet Forms to Calendar Events

Complendar is a simple, self-hosted Python utility that takes a public Google Sheet (typically generated from a Google Form) and converts the list of names and birthdays into a standard **$\text{.ics}$ calendar file**. This file can then be imported into any calendar application (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.) to create **yearly recurring birthday events**.

It supports both a simple **Command-Line Interface ($\text{CLI}$)** and a **Web Interface**.

## Quick Start (Web Interface)

Use `uv` to install and run the project from a local clone.

### Preliminaries

1.  **Google Sheet Link:** Ensure you have the public link to the Google Sheet that contains your name and birthday data. This sheet must have column headers that clearly indicate the **Name** and **Date** fields (e.g., "Your Name", "Birthday").
2.  **Required Tool:** You'll need the [`uv`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/astral-sh/uv%5D\(https://github.com/astral-sh/uv\)) tool for fast dependency management and running the project.

### 1\. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/complendar.git
cd complendar
uv sync
```

### 2\. Run the Web Server

Run the Python module to start the web server on $\text{port 8000}$.

```bash
uv run python -m complendar
```

This will output:

```
üåê Running on http://localhost:8000
```

### 3\. Usage

1.  Open your browser to **`http://localhost:8000`**.
2.  Paste your public Google Sheet link into the input box.
3.  Click **"Convert to ICS"**.
4.  The system will fetch, parse, and convert the data. Once complete, click the **"‚¨áÔ∏è Download ICS"** link to save the file.

-----

## CLI Usage

For power users, Complendar can be run directly from the terminal, bypassing the web interface.

### Syntax

```bash
uv run python -m complendar <SPREADSHEET_LINK> [OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]
```

### Example

```bash
uv run python -m complendar "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345EXAMPLE_SHEET_ID/edit#gid=0" birthdays.ics

# Output:
# Fetching CSV from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345EXAMPLE_SHEET_ID/edit#gid=0
# Parsing CSV‚Ä¶
# Guessed headers
# ‚Üí Name: "Your Name"
# ‚Üí Birthday: "Your Birthday"
# Converting to ICS‚Ä¶
# ‚úÖ Done. Saved to birthdays.ics
```

## Importing the $\text{.ics}$ File into Your Calendar

The generated **$\text{.ics}$** file contains **recurring yearly events** with reminders set for the day before and the day of each birthday. You need to **import** this file into your chosen calendar application.
